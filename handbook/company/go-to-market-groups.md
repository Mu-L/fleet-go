# 🦄 Go-To-Market groups

This page covers the prospect/customer journey and what all contributors (fleeties or not) need to know in order to make changes to the Go-To-Market (GTM) [philosophy](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-dont-we-sell-like-everyone-else), [strategy](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/go-to-market-groups#strategy), and execution at Fleet.

When communicating with future or current customers, hand offs [between departments](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#org-chart), contributors, or Fleet and external organizations can negatively effect the "Return On Investment" (ROI) for Fleet, our customers, and our friends in the community. Fleet uses cross-functional GTM groups to: 
- Minimize hand offs between internal and external stakeholders and maximize iteration and efficiency in the way we build the product.

> - Write down philosophies and show how the different pieces of the GTM process fit together on this "🦄 Go-To-Market groups" page.
> - Use the dedicated [departmental](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#org-chart) handbook pages for [🫧 Demand](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/marketing), [🌐 Digital Experience](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/digital-experience), [🐋 Sales](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/sales), [🌦️ Customer Success](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/customer-success), and [💸 Finance](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/finance) to keep track of specific responsibilities and recurring rituals designed to be read and used only by people within those departments.
